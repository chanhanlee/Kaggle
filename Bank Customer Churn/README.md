# 銀行客戶流失

------------
Acknowledgements

As we know, it is much more expensive to sign in a new client than keeping an existing one.

It is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible

###1.DATA Preprocessing & 敘述性統計 & 視覺化
無缺值，進行單熱編碼，一些感興趣的特徵敘述性統計及繪圖
###2.模型建立->模型選取
SVM、邏輯斯迴歸、決策樹、XGBOOST進行比較，最後選擇決策樹
因模型準確率都夠高，在此情形下 我選擇解釋性較佳的決策樹
